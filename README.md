# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

# Introduction:
In today's competitive business environment, effectively managing human capital is crucial. This HR Analytics Dashboard offers key workforce insights, focusing on employee attrition, job satisfaction, and demographics. By visualizing these metrics, the dashboard enables data-driven decisions for talent management and retention. This analysis will examine the dashboard's information to identify significant trends and patterns.

# Objective: 

1. - **Understanding key drivers of employee attrition:** Quantify attrition rates and their causes (salary, tenure, role, age, gender).
2. - **Assessing job satisfaction across roles:** Evaluate job satisfaction across roles and its influencing factors.
3. - **Identifying demographic factors influencing these trends:** Analyze workforce demographics and their relation to attrition/satisfaction.

# Methodology: 
Detailed examination of the HR Analytics Dashboard's visuals and data, including:

1. - **Data Extraction:** Extracting numerical and categorical data (attrition rates, employee counts, demographics, job satisfaction).
2. - **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing attrition and satisfaction across workforce segments (salary, gender, role, age, education).
3. - **Trend Identification:** Identifying significant trends and patterns in data visualizations.
4. - **Correlation Exploration:** Examining correlations between variables (e.g., job role and satisfaction).
5. - **Interpretation:** Drawing conclusions about attrition and satisfaction based on identified trends.

# Analysis: 
The HR Analytics Dashboard reveals several key areas:

- **Overall Workforce:** 1470 employees, average age 37, average salary 6.5K, 16.12% attrition (237 employees).
- **Attrition by Salary:** Highest attrition in "Upto 5K" bracket (163), decreasing with higher salary.
- **Attrition by Gender/Salary:** Higher attrition for both genders in lower salary brackets (Upto 5K).
- **Attrition by Tenure:** Attrition peaks around 2 years (59 employees), with notable points at 6 and 10 years.
- **Attrition by Department:** Varying attrition levels across departments (HR, R&D, Sales).
- **Attrition by Job Role:** Highest attrition: Laboratory Technicians (62), Sales Executives (57), Research Scientists (47); lower for Sales Representatives (33).
- **Attrition by Age:** Highest attrition: 26-35 age group (116), followed by 18-25 (44); decreasing with age.
- **Attrition by Education:** Life Sciences (38%), Medical (27%), Marketing (15%), Technical Degree (14%), Other (5%).
- **Job Satisfaction by Role:** Significant variation; lower for Laboratory Technicians (1-3), higher for Managers (8-13).
- **Average Job Metrics:** Average job involvement 2.73, average job satisfaction 2.7.
- **Role vs. Satisfaction:** Some roles (Healthcare Representatives, Managers) show higher average satisfaction than others (Laboratory Technicians, Sales 
    Executives).

# Key Findings:

1. - **Salary & Attrition:** Lowest salary bracket ("Upto 5K") has the highest attrition, indicating compensation is a major driver.
2. - **Early Tenure Attrition:** High attrition within the first two years suggests issues with onboarding/early career growth.
3. - **Role-Specific Attrition:** Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have the highest attrition rates.
4. - **Younger Employee Attrition:** 26-35 age group has the highest attrition, followed by 18-25.
5. - **Role-Based Satisfaction:** Job satisfaction varies significantly across roles.
6. - **Moderate Engagement/Satisfaction:** Overall job involvement and satisfaction are moderate.
7. - **Job Role and Satisfaction:** Certain job roles correlate with higher or lower satisfaction, potentially influencing attrition.

# Recommendations:

1. - **Adjust Compensation:** Review and adjust pay, especially for entry-level and high-attrition roles (e.g., Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives).
2. - **Enhance Onboarding/Development:** Improve onboarding and provide clear career paths for early-tenure employees.
3. - **Address High-Attrition Roles:** Investigate and address issues in high-attrition roles (e.g., workload, environment).
4. - **Target Younger Employees:** Develop retention strategies for younger employees (18-35), focusing on growth and work-life balance.
5. - **Improve Job Satisfaction:** Implement targeted interventions to boost satisfaction in low-scoring roles (e.g., job redesign, training).
6. - **Enhance Engagement:** Implement organization-wide strategies to improve employee engagement.
7. - **Investigate Department Attrition:** Conduct detailed analysis of departmental attrition.

# Conclusion:
The HR Analytics Dashboard highlights that salary, early tenure, specific roles, and age significantly impact attrition. Job satisfaction varies across roles, and overall engagement can be improved. Implementing the recommendations will help proactively address these issues, reduce turnover, and enhance workforce engagement and productivity. Continuous monitoring of these metrics is essential for data-driven decisions.
